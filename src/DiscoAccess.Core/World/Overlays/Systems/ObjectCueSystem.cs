    /// - While gliding, a short stereo blip each time the cursor crosses into or out of a thing's footprint
    ///   (a rising click on entering one, including swapping straight from one thing to another; a falling
    ///   click on leaving to bare ground), panned toward the thing. Gliding is too fast to narrate, so the
    ///   blip is all that sounds during motion.
    /// - On a glide stroke ending (the overlay's point readout), it contributes the name of the thing under
    ///   the cursor, so the player hears "crate; northeast, 2 meters" - the name first, then the position
    ///   from the spatial system.
    ///
    /// It senses the actionable set - accessible interactables and world-anchored orbs whose conditions are
    /// met - the exact set the Enter verb acts on, so what the cursor names and clicks can never disagree:
    /// scenery you cannot act on is not sensed. Self-gates like the audio systems - the blip falls silent
    /// under a cutscene, a lost-control moment, or a menu floating over the world.
