# Changelog

Release notes for Non-Visual Calculus. Ongoing work is recorded under the Unreleased heading; the release skill retitles that section to the version being released, and create-release.ps1 reads the tagged version's section as the GitHub release notes.

## Unreleased

New Features and improvements:

- Improved the mod's ability to identify doors: doors that shared one generic name now each speak a distinct one.

## V1.1.3

Bug fixes:

- Item effects now read as the game shows them: attribute bonuses, substance damage, and instruction lines were misread or skipped ("+1 None" for +1 Intellect).

## V1.1.2

Bug fixes:

- Fixed the stairs in the union office being untraversable with the cursor. Warning: they are still very narrow; the bookmark system is suggested in this room.

## V1.1.1

Bug fixes:

- A thought or paralyzer orb that pins the character can now be opened instead of every action refusing with "cutscene playing".
- Actions refused while an orb pins the character now say to interact with the orb.

## V1.1.0

New Features and improvements:

- The mod is now named Non-Visual Calculus, after the game's Visual Calculus skill.
- Updating removes the old Whirling in Words version and carries settings and bookmarks over to the new name.

## V1.0.1

New Features and improvements:

- The installer accepts the Epic Games Store version of the game.
- After an update, the installer log shows the release notes of the new versions.

Bug fixes:

- Fixed occasional dialogue freezes where every option stayed "not ready".
- The installer now asks for administrator rights and handles read-only files, fixing failed installs under Program Files.
- Durations combining hours and minutes now read correctly in languages other than English.

## V1.0.0

First release: full screen-reader access to Disco Elysium - The Final Cut.

- Speech output through Prism, following the game language for all thirteen supported languages
- Dialogue, responses, and skill checks with odds
- Menus, save/load, settings, journal, inventory, thought cabinet, and character sheet
- World navigation: movement cursor, interactable scanner, audio cues, and wall tones
- Learn-game-sounds reference on the pause menu
